# 🤖 Inverse Pendulum Control using Reinforcement Learning & Classical Control

This project explores balancing an inverted pendulum (CartPole) using three control strategies:

- **PPO Reinforcement Learning (Stable-Baselines3)**
- **PID Controller**
- **LQR-like State Feedback Controller**

It compares results from AI-based control versus traditional control theory.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Keep the pole upright (\(\theta \approx 0\))
- Maintain the cart near the track center
- Optimize stability and handle disturbances

Applications in real-world systems include:
- Humanoid robot balance
- Segway stabilization
- Robotic manipulators

## 📌 Problem Definition

### System: *Inverted Pendulum on a Cart*

State variables:
- `x` (cart position)
- `x_dot` (cart velocity)
- `theta` (pendulum angle in radians)
- `theta_dot` (pendulum angular velocity)

### Control Input:
Discrete force applied on the cart:
- `0` → Push Left
- `1` → Push Right

## 🚀 Solution Approaches

| Controller | Type             | Advantages               | Limitations                |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| PID        | Feedback Control | Simple, quick setup      | Hard to tune, fails under large disturbances |
| LQR        | Optimal Control  | Good stability           | Requires full system model |
| PPO        | Deep RL          | Learns/adapts, robust    | Needs training time, less predictable        |

---

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (PPO)

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) trains a neural network to map observations to actions to maximize the time the pole stays balanced.

Training loop:
- Observe system state
- Decide push direction
- Get reward for balance
- Improve behavior iteratively

## 🔧 Classical Controllers

### PID
Uses error: `target_angle (0) – theta`  
Control law:

$$u = K_p \cdot \text{error} + K_i \int{\text{error}\cdot dt} + K_d \frac{d(\text{error})}{dt}$$

Simple controller; works for small deviations, struggles with large disturbances.

### LQR-like Controller
State-feedback law:

$$u = -Kx$$

Where `K` is tuned for the linearized system. Offers stability but needs correct modeling.
